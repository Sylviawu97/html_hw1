        <h2> Life in Seattle
        </h2>
        <p>  Seattle's nickname as the Emerald City is well deserved. The nickname is directly related to the nature and greenery surrounding the city year-round, even during the dreary winter months thanks to evergreen forests that enclose the city on all sides.

            My pet-corgi
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Welsh Corgi ( Corgi, plural Corgis, or occasionally the etymologically consistent Corgwn; /ˈkɔːrɡuːn/) is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name corgi is derived from the Welsh words cor and ci (which is mutated to gi), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively.Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Physical differences are seen between the two breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and height. Their tails are of different shapes, and docking was previously performed on Corgis before the practice was largely banned.
